Creating Tensors

Tensor Operations (Math with Tensors)
Tensors support all kinds of mathematical operations, just like numbers or arrays.

Tensors on GPU (Speeding Up Computations)
This is where PyTorch truly shines for deep learning. GPUs are much faster for parallel computations.

# Building neural networks.
PyTorch provides modules and tools specifically for this:
torch.nn module: This contains all the building blocks for neural networks (layers like Linear, Conv2d, activation functions like ReLU, etc.).
torch.optim module: This contains optimization algorithms (like SGD, Adam) that help your neural network learn by adjusting its internal parameters.
torch.utils.data: For managing and loading your datasets efficiently.
